                <p>For this graph, we intentionally selected data from an external source, limiting it to states that enacted restrictions between January 2017 and November 2020 to produce a biased dataset. By selectively choosing what information is shown, we are able to manipulate the data to better suite our proposition.</p>

                <p>Unlike the previous graph, this one does not include a regression line. This was done purposely to allow the viewer to see the whole variability of the data. Specifically, the large number of points centered around the origin of the x-axis and the origin.

                <p> The title is fairly honest for the majority of the data; however, it downplays the outliers and fails to acknowledge that some states have increased access. This title was tailored to fit the purpose of our proposition, and also does not acknowledge that other factors are involved with the abortion rate changes. </p>

                <p>We changed the shape of our data to be open circles so it is easier to see points with similar values compared to closed circles. This allows viewers to see how much overlap there is around the origin and lean further towards the idea that there was not much increase in the abortion change. As for the color scheme, we stuck to neutral colors so that viewers could focus on all of the points. </p>

        <div class="hr-teal"></div>

        <p>We studied how changes in clinic access relate to changes in abortion rates because the topic clearly shows the difference between correlation and causation. In Figure 1, we limited the data to states that enacted restrictions between 2017 and 2020 using the JAMA subset, added a regression line, used a tighter plotting range, and wrote a title that suggested an increase. Additionally, we used a bright red fit line to pull attention to the upward slope while keeping the points neutral so the line stands out. We also used a tighter plotting window to make spacing between points look larger and to make the fitted line feel more prominent. In Figure 2, we used the full dataset with neutral colors, open circles to show overlap, and axes that kept the outliers. We used a cautious title that reflects the central cluster near zero while also downplaying the few extreme states. With that broader view, any strong trend faded.</p>
        <p>We chose not to fit a line on the full data (Figure 2) because the cloud of points is centered near the origin and a line would overstate a weak pattern. The lack of a reference line provides a clear benchmark without implying slope. We kept outliers and the full axis range so readers could judge stability with the noisy states included. The main cluster near zero matters more than a few extreme points, which is why we highlighted overlap and density around the origin. The biggest surprise was how much the title and a single fitted line shaped first impressions. Small choices such as scale, color, and whether to show a line changed what viewers believed before they inspected the points. We also made basic accessibility choices. We used color-blind-safe defaults and open circles so overlaps are visible without relying on color alone. Our audience is a general college classroom, so we favored simple encodings, neutral color, and captions that reduce misreadings.</p>
        <p>However, there are limits to what these charts can claim. Clinic counts do not capture telehealth, travel across state lines, population change, or policy timing, so we cannot make causal claims from these plots. Framing matters because titles, fitted lines, and axis ranges can pull attention toward a story the data does not fully support. Next time, we would add a small-multiples view by region or an interactive brush so readers can test subsets for themselves rather than rely only on our framing.</p>
